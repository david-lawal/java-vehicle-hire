JAVA IDE used: BlueJ

CONTENTS:
This was a uni Java project split into 4 parts where I built a vehicle hire system step-by-step. The system models how a company might rent out cars, vans, and trucks to customers. Started basic and ended up with file handling, inheritance, customers, and even switched to HashMaps.
What It Does
- Loads vehicle data from a file
- Supports different types of vehicles (car, van, truck)
- Lets you store customer data
- Generates unique customer IDs
- Switched from using ArrayLists to HashMaps for better performance
- All tested through a console-based Test class
Built With
- Java
- OOP (inheritance, polymorphism)
- File I/O (Scanner & PrintWriter)
- Collections (ArrayList & HashMap)
- CLI (text-based interaction)
